	<h2><strong>Understand Your City </strong></h2>

		<p>Do you want to learn more about how decisions are made at the City of London?</p>

		<p><strong><em>The City of London's Administrative Structure</em></strong><br>
		Links to information on the <a href="/city-hall/city-council/Pages/default.aspx">structure of City Council</a> and its <a href="/city-hall/committees/Pages/default.aspx">Committees</a>. Opportunities to serve on committees are identified here.</p>

		<p><strong><em>City Council and Committee Meetings</em></strong></p>

		<p>You will find <a href="/city-hall/meetings/Pages/default.aspx">agendas, minutes, reports</a> and supporting reference documents to City Council meetings as well as Council’s Standing Committees here.</p>

		<p>Can’t make it to the meeting? While a Council meeting is taking place, a <a href="/city-hall/meetings/Pages/default.aspx">live video stream</a> is available so Londoners can keep up to date at home and on their mobile device. &nbsp;Many committee meetings are also live streamed.</p>

		<p>&nbsp;</p>

	<h2><strong>Have Your Say at City Meetings</strong></h2>

		<p>If you want to make your views known about a matter being considered by a committee of Council you can request to speak or submit comments.</p>

	<h3><strong>Request to Speak</strong></h3>

		<p>In order to be given delegation status (request to speak) at a <a href="/city-hall/committees/standing-committees/Pages/default.aspx">Standing Committee</a> meeting you must make a request in writing to the City Clerk’s Office stating the purpose of your request.&nbsp; If it falls within the jurisdiction of the City of London we will place the request on the next available agenda for the appropriate Standing Committee. The Standing Committee will then make a recommendation to Municipal Council as to whether or not they wish to receive the delegation at a future meeting of the Standing Committee.</p>

		<p>If the request is approved by Council the delegation would then be placed on a future agenda of the Standing Committee.</p>

		<p>Londoners can also speak at a Public Participation Meeting before a Standing Committee. If a Public Participation Meeting is scheduled the public can register to speak prior to the agenda deadline and be listed on the agenda as a delegation, together with a written submission if they have one.&nbsp; Otherwise the public can just attend the meeting and the Chair of the Standing Committee will recognize them to speak after any individuals who have registered to speak by the agenda deadline.</p>

		<p>Your material should be submitted to the City Clerk's staff listed on the <a href="/city-hall/committees/standing-committees/Pages/default.aspx">relevant committee page</a> beforehand to ensure that it is appropriate.</p>

	<h3><strong>Submit Comments</strong></h3>

		<p>You can submit your comments in writing by mail, fax or email.</p>

		<p>You can find the mailing address, fax number and email address on the appropriate Council or <a href="/city-hall/committees/standing-committees/Pages/default.aspx">committee page</a>.</p>

		<p>The deadline to submit comments is the Monday the week before the meeting at 9 a.m.</p>

		<p>When sending comments that are intended for consideration by a committee or Council, please clearly indicate the following details:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>That you are submitting comments for distribution to a committee or to Council</li>
				<li>The name of the item and the item number</li>
				<li>The name of the Committee and the date of the meeting</li>
				<li>That we have your permission to place your comments on the public agenda and our website</li>
			</ul>
